## [[2. Layer-0 — Seed Axioms|Layer-0]] | [[2. Layer-0 — Seed Axioms|Seed Axioms]]
### Purpose
#### the non metadata tag version of the individual notes
- preamble
- demonstrated in the very name
- paradigm how?
- Kuhnian sense in the state of a particular discipline or subject, or
- Personal world view
- Introduce seed axiom r public and indexical registers as a central component, then touch briefly on other 2 [[2. Layer-0 — Seed Axioms|seed axioms]] just in reference.
### Non-Goals
Lorem Ipsum Dolor
### Seed Axiom F | Finitude / Asymptote
>A knower is a **[[Time]]-bounded, [[Attention]]-bounded** *indexical process* operating under *public constraints*.
#### Forbids
- World-[[Scope]] closure (“this is complete / final / total”) without quarantine.
- Treating confidence as unlimited budget (infinite ∞ [[Attention]] / infinite ∞ [[Time]]).
- Freezing a live model into a [[Dogma|dogmatic]] [[Identity]] badge (anti-update).
#### Common failure mode
- [[Scope]]/completeness inflation; budget denial; pointer-closure mistaken for world-closure.
### Seed Axiom R | [[Register]] Integrity
>There are **two irreducible registers** that may not be eliminated without [[Category Error]]:
>1. **Public invariants / [[Belief]]-independent constraints**
	>*([[Empirical]] facts, laws of nature, stabilized via methods of inquiry)*
>2. **Indexical presence**
	>*(“I / here / now / what-it’s-like” + commitment [[Space]])*
#### Forbid
- Untyped moves (no [[Register]] declared).
- Cross-[[Register]] export/import without an explicit [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|inferential bridge]] rule.
- Total reduction of one [[Register]] into the other with zero remainder.
- “Mixed” typing presented as a third [[Register]] (it’s usually just untyped crossing).
#### Common failure mode
- _[[Metaphysics]] smuggling_: a subverted [[Register]] mix gets treated as successfully crossed and “obvious” (often phenomenal).
### Seed Axiom U | Unification precedence
>Nothing is available for analysis unless it has already been unified (synthesized) in [[Experience]].
#### Forbids
- Treating analysis as if it can access a “raw manifold” prior to unity.
- Confusing reverse-engineering with inversion (thinking you can uniquely recover the manifold as something in-itself to behold).
- “*Definition-first [[Metaphysics]]*” that forgets **synthesis is doing the enabling work**.
#### Common failure mode
- _Trying to Bite Your Teeth_: trying to observe the constituting operation *as if it were just another [[Object]] in the same [[Register]]*.
### Corollary | Inference Lifeline (Hard Typing)
1. **Inference dies without hard typing**  
   → structural constraint ([[Logic]] / [[Register]] integrity)
2. **Hard typing keeps inference alive under finitude**  
   → what makes inference possible *while* the agent exists
3. **Inference made from finitude does not survive death**  
   → [[Temporal]] bound on epistemic authority (no posthumous “infinite budget”)
Implications:
- Untyped claims do not merely “lack rigor”; they fail to qualify as inferential moves.
- Epistemic authority is horizon-bounded: it depends on a living ability to answer challenges, revise, and supply procedures.
- “Closure” is always a typed artifact ([[Scope]], budget, quarantine), never a world-capture.

## [[3. Layer-1 — Pillars|Layer-1]] | [[3. Layer-1 — Pillars|Pillars]]
### Purpose
- [[3. Layer-1 — Pillars|Layer-1]] contains 2 [[3. Layer-1 — Pillars|pillars]]: **[[Semantic Geometry]]** (*Public-facing structural [[Ontology]]*) and **Dynamic [[Coherence]]** (*indexical [[Praxis]]*).
- They provide **disciplined representational machinery** used to **model/describe public invariants (Public)** and update/act under finitude (indexical), with explicit bridges when crossing registers.
### Non-Goals
- Not a metaphysical proof engine.
- Not a guarantee of [[Truth]] or completeness (see seed axiom F).
- Not a substitute for [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]] rules: cross-[[Register]] claims remain non-admissible without declared inferential bridges.
### Pillar [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Interface]] Contract
- **[[Semantic Geometry]]** produces public structural models.
- **Dynamic [[Coherence]]** produces indexical updates + telemetry.
- **Neither exports across registers without inferential bridges.**
### Pillar A | [[Semantic Geometry]]
>**Primary [[Register]]:** Public (non-indexical), with explicit inferential bridges when used metaphorically or imported into indexical [[Praxis]].
>
>**Function:** [[Ontology]]-as-structure, models the world in terms of relations, constraints, symmetries, invariants, and informational/geometric structure (rather than substances).
#### Imports (what it requires)
- Admissibility constraints from [[2. Layer-0 — Seed Axioms|Layer-0]] (R/F/U).
- [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|Inferential bridge]] rules when mapping to Indexical commitments or normative directives.
- [[Empirical]] constraints (via [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Interface]] testing loop).
#### Exports (what it produces)
- Structural descriptors (relations / constraints / invariants).
- Candidate isomorphisms (structure-preservation claims) _with declared breaks_.
- Public models suitable for testing / critique.
#### Common Failure Modes
- Reifying “structure” as [[Ontology]]-complete ([[Content]]-closure).
- Smuggling metaphor as literal public claim (untyped [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]]).
- “[[Isomorphism]] inflation” (claiming structure-same without declaring breaks).
### Pillar B: Dynamic [[Coherence]]

>**Primary [[Register]]:** Indexical (first-person), with explicit measurement/report inferential bridges when exporting to Public claims.
>
>**Function:** [[Praxis]], operational discipline for **updating, modeling, and [[Consensus Layer|reality]]-testing** under finitude.
#### Instrumentation (*non-moralizing telemetry*)
- **[[Coherence]] Metrics** (tracking signal, [[Drift]], constraints; not “good person / bad person”).
- **[[Horizon Discipline]] / [[Belief]] [[Belief Hygiene|Hygiene]]** ([[Scope]] control, update loops, quarantine discipline).
#### Imports (what it requires)
- [[2. Layer-0 — Seed Axioms|Layer-0]] finitude budgeting (stop rules, revision triggers).
- [[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]] linting (no untyped crossing; no closure cosplay).
- Measurement/report inferential bridges when making public claims.
#### Exports (what it produces)
- “Declared commitments (indexical) that may be exported to public coordination only via [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|inferential bridge]] rules.”
- indexical reports ([[Experience]] + commitments) with declared [[Scope]].
- Update actions (model revisions, [[Attention]] allocation, stop rules).
- Telemetry traces (metrics) that can be bridged to public constraints when appropriate.
#### Common Failure Modes
- Treating telemetry as moral verdict (moralization leak).
- Over-indexicalization (“because I feel X, therefore public [[Consensus Layer|reality]] is X”).
- Under-specifying conditions (no [[Scope]]; no stop rule).

## [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Layer-2]] | [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Interface]]
### Purpose
- [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Interface]] is where the system **cashes out:** it imports external material, runs stress tests, instantiates models, and produces disciplined outputs suitable for public coordination and revision (observable consequences / decision procedure / practical application / theoretical application). 
### Non-Goals
- Not a worldview capture layer.
- Not a moral [[Oracle]]. 
- Not "proof by [[Art]]," "proof by [[Rhetoric]]," or "proof by citation."
- Not a substitute for [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]] rules: [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Interface]] does not legalize untyped crossings; it **enforces** [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]] discipline via declared inferential bridges + cash-out + tests/instantiation. 
- Not a reification of [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Ethics]] into a [[3. Layer-1 — Pillars|Layer-1]] Pillar because [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|ethics]] is not a [[Register]] but rather, a **constraint layer on coordination**.
### Imports (what it requires): 
- Outputs from [[3. Layer-1 — Pillars|Pillars]] (Public models; Indexical telemetry/commitments).
- Seed constraints + [[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]] linting (typing, inferential bridges, quarantine discipline).
- External sources (literature/media/[[Art]]/experiments) with provenance metadata.
### Exports (what it produces)
- Validated/invalidated [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|inferential bridge]] rules (or at least constrained admissibility zones).
- Compiled notes (typed summaries; extracted constraints; identified failure modes).
- Cash-out artifacts (procedures, predictions, applications).
- Ethical constraints for coordination (commitment outputs) with explicit justifications.
### Common Failure Modes
- “Proof by [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|aesthetic]]” ([[Art]] treated as certificate).
- “Proof by [[Rhetoric]]” (persuasion treated as [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|inferential bridge]]).
- [[Isomorphism]] inflation (structure claims without breaks/conditions).
- Moralization leak (telemetry treated as moral verdict).
- Political capture (system used as [[Identity]] weapon rather than constraint discipline).
- [[Scope]] creep / [[Content]]-closure smuggling (world-closure without quarantine).
### [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Interface]] Components
#### A) Cash-out & [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|Inferential Bridge]] Enforcement
- **Job**: enforce [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]] discipline for any Public ↔ Indexical import/export; require cash out targets.
	- Every cross-[[Register]] move must declare:
		- registers, 
		- modes, 
		- inferential [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]] rule, 
		- conditions, 
		- preserves, 
		- what breaks. 
	- Every [[Applied]] model must declare a cash out target:
		- Observable consequences (what would be seen/measured if true/useful)
		- Decision procedure (what action rule it implies)
		- Practical application / theoretical application
#### B) Isomorphic Mappings ([[Form]], without hallucinating [[Content]])
- **Job:** map [[Form]] or structure across domains without smuggling [[Content]]. 
	- Every [[Isomorphism]] must state:
		- Source domain → target domain
		- What is preserved
		- What breaks; often [[Content]]/units/[[Agency]] assumptions
		- Method(s), condition(s), justification(s)
#### C) Literature Review / Cultural & Political Commentary
- **Job:** import external lenses and compile them into the system.
	- For any source:
		- Type moves by [[Register]] + mode.
		- Identify missing inferential bridges (especially where "mixed" presents as obvious).
		- Flag any [[Scope]] creep, [[Content]]-closure, and/or reification.
		- Extract useable constraints, not vibes.
#### D) [[Art]] / Creative Writing / Experiments (instantiation + test)
- **Job:** demonstration, not metaphysical certification.
	- [[Art]]/experiments are used to:
		- Instantiate a [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]].
		- Make an [[Isomorphism]] experiential (indexical access) without overclaiming.
		- Test whether a model cashes out phenomenally and operationally under declared constraints.
#### E) [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Ethics]] as [[4. Layer-2 — Interface|Interface]] Constraints ([[Epistemic Golden Rule]] / Post-Perennialism)
- **Type:** commitment (emergent): indexical commitments + public coordination under constraint.
- **Job:** constrain action and discourse in public [[Space]] using symmetry and harm-sensitivity without [[register]] coercion. 
	- Epistemic symmetry (apply same admissibility demands to in-group/out-group, self/other).
	- Power/[[agency]] [[awareness]] (who bears costs; who has voice; who is coerced).
	- [[Belief Hygiene]] in public discourse (no untyped [[Metaphysics]]; no closure cosplay; explicit [[scope]]).

## [[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]] | [[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Meta-Ontology]]
### Purpose
- [[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]] specifies presuppositions and constraints of intelligibility (manifold-as-given → synthesis → [[object]]-unity). It functions as the ground for typing + linting that prevents illegitimate metaphysical reification and cross-[[register]] smuggling or coercion.
### Non-goals
- **Not** an [[ontology]] of “what ultimately exists.”
- **Not** a causal model of cognition.
- **Not** a mechanism that recovers world-[[scope]] completeness from inside finitude.
### Core primitives
#### The 'move' (an atomic unit):
- Is any _(necessarily) typed **act of intelligibility**_ (perceptual “taking-as,” conceptual grouping, judgment, report, commitment, directive). Linguistic “claims” are one surface *[[form]]* of moves.
#### Registers (base types):
- **Public (non-indexical):** shareable targets, public invariants, *[[belief]]-independent constraints*.
- **Indexical (first-person):** [[attention]]/[[embodiment]]/finitude constraints, lived givenness, commitment [[space]] (I/me/what-it's-likeness).
##### Modes (not extra registers)
- Descriptive ([[intrinsic]] to Public)
- Experiential report ([[intrinsic]] to Indexical)
- Commitment (emergent): coordination-directives justified via public constraints + explicit bridges + explicit commitments
#### [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|Inferential Bridge]]:
- An explicitly constrained rule that licenses translation between non-identical registers while *preserving intelligibility* and **tracking loss** (measurement, [[operationalization]], report protocol, model mapping, etc.). Without this, an intelligible inference cannot be made.
#### Reification (illegitimate):
- Treating [[representation]], or a product thereof ([[object]]-unity (the resulting synthesis from [[manifold of perception]]) / [[concept]] / model / [[object]]) as ontically closed or world-complete in-itself; violating [[register]] integrity without declaring the [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|inferential bridge]], in whole (not just what tracks, also what is lost).
#### Seed axiom jurisdiction
- This layer, [[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]] does not “prove” the [[2. Layer-0 — Seed Axioms|Seed Axioms]] rather, it defines the grounds of which they function as admissibility constraints. Full axiom statements live in Layer 0.
##### Seed Axiom F | Finitude / Asymptote
- World-[[scope]] closure is asymptotic under finitude (no view-from-everywhere/nowhere from inside the system).
- Reference-[[scope]] closure is often attainable (pointers can be fixed: what term, what [[register]], what inferential [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]]).
- Therefore the aim is [[Coherence]] under constraint (update > closure).
##### Seed Axiom R | [[Register]] Integrity
- Every move **must** declare its [[Register]] (Public / Indexical).
- Modes (not extra registers):
	 - Descriptive ([[Intrinsic]] to Public)
	 - Experiential report ([[Intrinsic]] to Indexical)
	 - Commitment (emergent): normative directives enabling coordination in public [[Space]], typically justified via public invariants + explicit inferential bridges + explicit commitments
- Any cross-[[Register]] move must be typed and bridged.
- Any attempt to reduce one [[Register]] entirely into the other with zero remainder is a [[Category Error]].
- Lint note: “Mixed” is not a stable type. Treat “mixed” as a lint flag.
##### Seed Axiom U | Unification/Synthesis precedence
- Analysis presupposes synthesis: unification of the manifold-as-given is the enabling operation.
- [[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]] treats “manifold” as manifold-as-given / limit-[[Concept]] and constrains how [[Object]]-unity talk is made admissible.
#### No-[[Metaphysics]]-Token  
- The token “[[Metaphysics]]” is non-admissible unless accompanied by:
	- a declared posit (what is [[being]] posited),
	- a declared [[Register]], and
	- a declared [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|inferential bridge]] (how the posit connects to admissible [[Experience]] / invariants / practice).
#### [[Scope]] & completeness typing
- **Referential [[Scope]]/completeness:** pointer-closure (what does X refer to, which [[Register]], which inferential [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]]?) | often attainable.
- **[[Content]] [[Scope]]/completeness:** world-closure (“what it ultimately IS”) | treated as asymptotic under finitude unless explicitly quarantined as speculation.
#### Inferential [[Inferential Bridge (Rule)|bridge]] schema (required [[Form]])
- X ([[Register]] A, Mode α)
- → via Method(s) M under Conditions C
- → Y ([[Register]] B, Mode β)
- Preserves: P
- Breaks: B
- Justification: J
#### Versioning / Invalidation
- This system is “evergreen” only in the sense of versioned constraints. Invalidation triggers a version update when:
	- [[2. Layer-0 — Seed Axioms|seed axioms]] become internally inconsistent, or    
	- linting permits illicit reification / untyped coercion, or    
	- the two-pass legend yields contradictions with finitude constraints.
### Transcendental Discipline
##### Model [[Class]] Restriction
1. **Inference dies without hard typing**  
    → structural constraint ([[logic]]/[[register]] integrity)
2. **Hard typing keeps inference alive under finitude**  
    → what makes inference possible _while_ the agent exists
3. **Inference made from finitude does not survive death**  
    → [[temporal]] bound on epistemic authority

**Epistemic authority is indexical and mortal**.

[[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]], through transcendental discipline, governs **what kinds of claims are allowed to count as world-talk at all**, and **how valid claims may be inferred once admitted**. Explicitly split into two orthogonal checks: validity of inference (general [[logic]]) and admissibility of world talk (transcendental [[logic]]).
#### 1. Validity of Inference (VoI) — General [[Logic]]
**VoI answers:**  
> Given some premises, does this conclusion follow correctly?
- VoI is [[Register]]-agnostic. It does not ask whether premises are meaningful, grounded, or admissible as world-claims — only whether the inferential move is coherent.
Includes:
- Deductive validity
- Probabilistic [[Coherence]] (Bayesian updating; consistency of credences)
- Internal model [[Coherence]]
- “If X, then Y” correctness
Bayesian reasoning lives **here** as an update rule, not as a license to introduce hypotheses.
**Key point:**  
A conclusion can be perfectly valid under VoI and still be **illegitimate world-talk**.
#### 2. Admissibility of World-Talk (AoW-t) — Transcendental [[Logic]]
**AoW-t answers:**  
> Is this claim even eligible to be called “about the world” (Public-typed), given finite agents?
- AoW-t is a **typing judgment**, not an inference rule. It gates entry into the Public [[Register]].
A claim is **admissible as Public/world-talk if and only if** it satisfies all of the following:
##### AoW-t Criteria (Finite-Agent Discipline)
1. **Operational Anchor**
   The claim specifies (explicitly or implicitly) an evidence-producing procedure.  
   *What would be done or observed?*
2. **Intersubjective Transform**
   Another finite agent could, in principle, access the same evidential structure via lawful transformations  
   (measurement, translation, calibration, behavioral alignment, correction loops).
3. **Finitude Constraint**
   No appeal to omniscience, infinite precision, or unreachable “in-principle” cheats.  
   Possibility must be **procedurally approachable**, not merely conceivable.
4. **[[Register]] Integrity**
   No indexical [[Content]] (“for me,” “as experienced,” private access) is smuggled in while presenting the claim as world-level.
If any criterion fails, the claim is **ill-typed as world-talk**.  
It may still exist as Indexical, speculative, poetic, or heuristic — just not Public.
#### 3. [[Objectivity]] (Bayesianized, but Disciplined)
Within the [[Class]] of **AoW-t-admissible claims**, Bayesian reasoning applies:
- Competing models are compared via shared update rules.
- Evidence shifts posteriors.
- **[[Objectivity]]** tracks *posterior stability under admissible intersubjective transforms*.
Crucially:
- Bayesian updating **selects among** admissible models.
- AoW-t **defines the model [[Class]] itself**.
This blocks:
- “Omniscient observer” grounding (fails finitude).
- Metaphysical laundering of private intuitions into Public claims.
- Sci-fi bridges with no access path.
#### 4. Plurality and [[Objectivity]] (Transcendental Result)
[[Objectivity]] is constitutively intersubjective in [[Form]]:
- A claim counts as objective only if it is formulated as invariant under [[Perspective]].
- [[Perspective]]-invariance has [[Content]] only relative to a plurality of possible finite subjects.
This plurality need not be actually instantiated at all times.
It must be pragmatically possible under finitude (reachable procedures, not cheats).

Animal communication is admissible.
Omniscience is not.
This is not [[metaphysics]] — it’s discipline.

#### 5. One-sentence compression
**[[1. Layer-M — Meta-Ontology|Layer-M]] separates valid inference from admissible world-talk: VoI checks whether conclusions follow, while AoW-t determines whether a claim is even eligible for Public [[Objectivity]], restricting world-talk to models finite agents could, in principle, mutually update via shared procedures.**
